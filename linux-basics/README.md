# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals Series (TryHackMe)

## 🧭 Objective
Learn core Linux skills for cybersecurity tasks including command-line navigation, file permissions, user management, and practical system interaction in a terminal environment.

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Core Commands**: `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `man`
- **User & Privilege Tools**: `whoami`, `sudo`, `passwd`
- **Permissions & Ownership**: `chmod`, `chown`, file mode flags (`rwx`)
- **Search & Edit Utilities**: `grep`, `find`, `nano`, `cat`, `less`
- **I/O Redirection**: `>`, `>>`, `|`, `tee`

## 📖 Analysis Summary
- Developed confidence using the CLI as the primary interface for Linux tasks.
- Built muscle memory with essential commands used in forensics, scanning, and scripting.
- Strengthened understanding of file access control and system structure.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Command-line fluency for Linux environments
- Permission auditing and modification
- Basic shell scripting and output chaining
- Comfort with navigating and using Linux systems in a terminal

## 🧰 Real-World Application
Linux systems are everywhere in cybersecurity — from servers to attacker-controlled machines. These fundamentals apply directly to real-world tasks like log analysis, malware hunting, and system auditing.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This was my first hands-on experience managing a Linux system entirely through the terminal. I now feel confident using Linux as a working environment in both offensive and defensive roles.
