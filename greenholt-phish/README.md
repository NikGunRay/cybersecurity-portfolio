# The Greenholt Phish üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Overview
As a SOC Analyst, I investigated a suspicious email forwarded by a Sales Executive at Greenholt PLC. The sender used an unusual greeting and included an unexpected file attachment related to a financial transaction that was never discussed. The goal was to determine the legitimacy of the message and assess potential threats.

## Objectives
- Investigate email header fields
- Verify sender identity and reply address
- Analyze attachment hash and type
- Validate SPF and DMARC configurations
- Identify infrastructure behind the message

## Key Findings

## Analysis Summary
- The mismatch between the display name, email address, and reply-to address raised red flags.
- The attachment was disguised with a misleading file name and extension.
- SPF and DMARC records showed some protection, but potential spoofing risks remained.
- The originating IP was linked to Hostwinds LLC, not a reputable business network.
- The file's `.CAB` extension masked the true `.RAR` archive, commonly used to deliver malicious payloads.

## Tools Used
- **Thunderbird** ‚Äì Open and inspect `.eml` file
- **VirusTotal** ‚Äì Analyze hash of attachment
- **MXToolbox** ‚Äì Review SPF/DMARC records
- **Command Line** ‚Äì `file`, `sha256sum` for local hash and type validation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Email header and metadata analysis
- File extension obfuscation detection
- Threat intel basics (IP and domain reputation)
- Malware triage and safe handling
