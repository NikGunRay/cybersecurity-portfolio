# 🛡️ Nik Gray – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Nik — a cybersecurity sales pro turned technical learner. This GitHub is a living portfolio where I document hands-on experience across key cybersecurity domains like email security, phishing forensics, Linux and Windows hardening, SOC-style analysis, and insider threat response.

## 🚨 Real-World Labs (TryHackMe, Capture-the-Flag, Practical Labs)

### ✅ Active Directory Basics (TryHackMe)
Built and managed OUs, delegated permissions, and configured GPOs for real-world use cases like password policies and session locking.  
**Skills demonstrated**: Active Directory administration, PowerShell delegation, Kerberos vs. NTLM authentication, GPO deployment

### ✅ Disgruntled IT Logic Bomb Investigation (Insider Threat | Linux Forensics)
Investigated a logic bomb planted by an insider on a corporate Linux system  
Traced user command history, privilege escalation, and cron-triggered backdoor  
Identified bomb.sh disguised as `/bin/os-update.sh` and scheduled via crontab  
**Skills demonstrated**: Linux forensics, cron analysis, IOC extraction, insider threat detection

### ✅ The Greenholt Phish (Phishing & Email Forensics)
Analyzed a suspicious email forwarded to the SOC team  
Extracted email headers (Return-Path, SPF, DMARC, Origin IP)  
Identified spoofed sender, mismatched reply-to, and suspicious file attachment  
Used SHA256 hashes and Thunderbird to validate malicious payload  
**Skills demonstrated**: phishing detection, header analysis, threat investigation
