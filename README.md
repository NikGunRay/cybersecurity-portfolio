# 🛡️ Nik Gray – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Nik — a cybersecurity sales pro turned technical learner. This GitHub is a living portfolio where I’m documenting my hands-on experience across key cybersecurity domains like email security, phishing forensics, OS fundamentals, and SOC-style analysis.

## 🚨 Real-World Labs (TryHackMe, Capture-the-Flag, Practical Labs)

### ✅ The Greenholt Phish (Phishing & Email Forensics)
- Analyzed a suspicious email forwarded to the SOC team
- Extracted email headers (Return-Path, SPF, DMARC, Origin IP)
- Identified spoofed sender, mismatched reply-to, and suspicious file attachment
- Used SHA256 hashes and Thunderbird to validate malicious payload
- **Skills demonstrated:** phishing detection, header analysis, threat investigation

### ✅ Windows Fundamentals (1–3)
- Navigated GUI elements, file system structure (NTFS), and system folders
- Worked with System Configuration (msconfig), Task Manager, Registry Editor
- Explored Windows Defender Firewall, UAC, BitLocker, and Event Logs
- **Skills demonstrated:** system hardening, endpoint defense, privilege management

### ✅ Linux Fundamentals
- Learned permissions, file structure, user management, and bash commands
- Explored log files, scheduling tasks with cron, and system monitoring
- **Skills demonstrated:** Linux CLI, hardening basics, log review

### ✅ Networking, DNS, HTTP & Web Protocols
- Understood how DNS queries resolve
- Investigated HTTP requests/responses using tools like Wireshark and curl
- **Skills demonstrated:** network fundamentals, protocol analysis, packet inspection
