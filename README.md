# 🛡️ Nik Gray – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Nik — a cybersecurity sales pro turned technical learner. This GitHub is a living portfolio where I document hands-on experience across key cybersecurity domains like email security, phishing forensics, Linux and Windows hardening, SOC-style analysis, and insider threat response.

## 🚨 Real-World Labs (TryHackMe, Capture-the-Flag, Practical Labs)

### ✅ Disgruntled IT Logic Bomb Investigation (Insider Threat | Linux Forensics)
- Investigated a logic bomb planted by an insider on a corporate Linux system
- Traced user command history, privilege escalation, and cron-triggered backdoor
- Identified `bomb.sh` disguised as `/bin/os-update.sh` and scheduled via crontab
- **Skills demonstrated:** Linux forensics, cron analysis, IOC extraction, insider threat detection

### ✅ The Greenholt Phish (Phishing & Email Forensics)
- Analyzed a suspicious email forwarded to the SOC team
- Extracted email headers (Return-Path, SPF, DMARC, Origin IP)
- Identified spoofed sender, mismatched reply-to, and suspicious file attachment
- Used SHA256 hashes and Thunderbird to validate malicious payload
- **Skills demonstrated:** phishing detection, header analysis, threat investigation

### ✅ Windows Fundamentals (1–3)
- Navigated GUI elements, file system structure (NTFS), and system folders
- Worked with System Configuration (msconfig), Task Manager, Registry Editor
- Explored Windows Defender Firewall, UAC, BitLocker, and Event Logs
- **Skills demonstrated:** system hardening, endpoint defense, privilege management

### ✅ Linux Fundamentals
- Learned permissions, file structure, user management, and bash commands
- Explored log files, scheduling tasks with cron, and system monitoring
- **Skills demonstrated:** Linux CLI, hardening basics, log review

### ✅ Networking, DNS, HTTP & Web Protocols
- Understood how DNS queries resolve and HTTP request lifecycles
- Investigated packet-level data using tools like Wireshark and curl
- **Skills demonstrated:** network fundamentals, protocol analysis, packet inspection
