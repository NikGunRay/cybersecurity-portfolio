# 🔧 Security Tools & Notes

This section contains practical notes and summaries from hands-on cybersecurity tools used across labs, challenges, and real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools I've Worked With:

### 🐙 Nmap
- Network scanning, host discovery, service/version detection
- Sample usage: `nmap -sV -A target.com`

### 🔍 Wireshark
- Analyzed DNS requests, HTTP traffic, TCP handshakes
- Applied filters like `http.request` and `dns.qry.name == "example.com"`

### ⚔️ Metasploit Framework
- Exploit development and post-exploitation
- Used for simulated attacks in safe environments

### 🧰 Netcat
- Created reverse shells and basic file transfers
- Example: `nc -lvp 4444` for listener setup

### 🦾 Others:
- `Burp Suite` for web traffic interception
- `Hydra` for brute-force testing
- `tcpdump`, `enum4linux`, `dirb`, `nikto`, etc.
