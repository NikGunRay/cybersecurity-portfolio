# ■ Information Disclosure & Multi-Tenant Context Leak

## ■ Objective  
While accessing a pharmacy portal from a mobile device, I uncovered improper
error handling that revealed backend implementation details, alongside symptoms
of potential tenant misrouting. This wasn’t a deliberate test.The issue was
discovered organically during a routine login, but the impact warranted a
closer look.

## ■ Tools & Techniques Used  
- Mobile browser (Safari iOS)  
- Network switching (Wi-Fi → 5G)  
- Static review of server error content  
- CVE research against disclosed framework versions  

## ■ Target  
A multi-tenant pharmacy portal URL (redacted for responsible disclosure)

## ■ Key Findings / Evidence  

| Issue                     | Details                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exposed Stack Trace       | Controller name, line numbers, internal file paths                      |
| Framework Info Leaked     | .NET Framework 4.0.30319, ASP.NET 4.8.9287.0                            |
| Server Error Message      | NullReferenceException in `MultiTenantController.OnException()`         |
| Erratic Login Behavior    | Missing user data on first load; re-authentication resolved it          |
| CVEs Potentially Relevant | CVE-2023-36796, CVE-2023-24936, CVE-2023-29331                          |

## ■ Analysis Summary  
- The portal displayed unhandled .NET exceptions to the user, leaking
  sensitive implementation data.  
- Framework version headers and error trace details give attackers
  reconnaissance leverage.  
- Login inconsistencies may indicate improper tenant context resolution
  or race conditions.  
- No exploit was attempted but exposure alone introduces risk in a
  regulated healthcare context.

## ■ Skills Demonstrated  
- Real-time incident triage and safe disclosure assessment  
- Error analysis with multi-tenant implications  
- Recon-level CVE threat modeling  
- Empathy-first reporting mindset. no exploitation, just visibility  

## ■ Real-World Application  
This is a textbook example of how front-end instability can expose serious
back-end issues. In healthcare or finance, these kinds of leaks open the door
to compliance violations or targeted attacks. Being able to recognize and
report it responsibly is a core cybersecurity skill and not just red teaming,
but blue teaming with accountability.

## ■ Lessons Learned  
Always read the error page. Seemingly routine bugs can expose architectural
flaws, especially in multi-tenant apps. This experience reminded me that a
good security mindset means staying alert, even during everyday use.

## ■ Completion Status  
Self-guided real-world report, discovered during personal use of a medical
web portal.
