# 🌐 Networking, DNS, & HTTP Fundamentals (TryHackMe)

This section of my portfolio captures essential networking concepts, particularly how DNS and HTTP operate and how they’re analyzed in a cybersecurity context.

---

### 📡 Networking Essentials Covered:

- Identified OSI and TCP/IP models and mapped protocols to each layer
- Understood packet structure and data encapsulation
- Used tools like `ping`, `tracert`, and `ipconfig/ifconfig` for troubleshooting
- Analyzed IP addressing and subnetting basics

---

### 🌐 DNS Deep Dive:

- Investigated how domain names resolve to IP addresses
- Explored DNS record types: A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, NS
- Used `nslookup`, `dig`, and `host` for domain investigations
- Identified DNS poisoning techniques and mitigation strategies

---

### 🌍 HTTP Insights:

- Broke down HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Examined request/response structure including status codes, headers, cookies
- Used `curl` and browser dev tools to analyze HTTP traffic
- Understood common vulnerabilities like header manipulation, redirects, and insecure methods
