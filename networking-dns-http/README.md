# 🌐 Networking, DNS, & HTTP Fundamentals (TryHackMe)

## 🧭 Objective
Understand core networking principles and analyze how DNS and HTTP protocols function in real-world environments, with a focus on how they’re leveraged and misused in cybersecurity.

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Network CLI Tools**: `ping`, `tracert`, `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`
- **DNS Utilities**: `nslookup`, `dig`, `host`
- **Web Tools**: `curl`, browser developer tools
- **Packet Analysis**: (lightweight inspection, not deep Wireshark)

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered
| Area                | Highlights                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Networking**       | OSI & TCP/IP models, packet structure, encapsulation, IP addressing       |
| **DNS**             | A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, NS records; DNS resolution and spoofing tactics   |
| **HTTP**            | Request/response structure, methods (GET/POST/etc), headers, cookies       |

## 📖 Analysis Summary
- Mapped foundational network concepts to common cybersecurity tasks.
- Explored how DNS can be both a lookup tool and an attack vector.
- Practiced manual HTTP requests and response interpretation.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Protocol-level understanding of DNS and HTTP
- Command-line investigation of domains and endpoints
- Manual traffic analysis using CLI and browser tools

## 🧰 Real-World Application
Cybersecurity professionals must understand how normal traffic behaves to detect abnormalities. These concepts are directly useful for phishing detection, malware C2 tracking, and network triage.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
I learned how to move beyond passive reliance on tools and actively interrogate networks and web requests. It gave me a solid foundation for future packet capture and intrusion analysis work.
